# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
# name属性用来指定这个工作流的名字
name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
# 这个部分用来指定能够触发工作流执行的事件
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  # 当对分支main进行push操作的时候，这个工作流就被触发了
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# 工作流是由一个或多个的jobs构成的，在jobs里来说明要交给GitHub aciton执行的任务
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  # 这个jobs中的一个任务，名字叫build(随便怎么取)
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    # 用来指定这个任务在什么操作系统上跑(服务器是GitHub免费提供的)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    # 指出这个build任务的步骤
    steps:
      # 步骤，这里只写了一个步骤，目的是输出hello github acition
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
